# CRASH CAP — Memory Crash Capture & Control Panel

🚨 **CRASH CAP** is a terminal-based tool to monitor and manage system memory usage, processes, and caches on Linux systems. It provides real-time stats, alerts on high memory usage, process management commands, and easy cache cleanup — all with an interactive colorful console interface

## Features

✅ Display detailed memory and CPU usage statistics  
✅ Show memory usage aggregated by user  
✅ List top memory-consuming processes and suggest cleanup  
✅ Kill processes gracefully or forcefully by PID  
✅ Monitor memory usage continuously in the background with desktop notifications *(non-root only)*  
✅ Display and clean system and user caches safely  
✅ Launch a live process monitor in a new terminal window  
✅ Beautiful animated UI with colored prompts, progress spinners, and alerts  
✅ Detect system freezes before they occur by tracking memory thresholds

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crash-cap.git
   cd crash-cap
2. install requirements packages and run :
   ```bash
   pip3 install requirements.txt
   python3 crashcap.py
   ```
3. (Optional) Adjust settings in config.json for memory threshold and check interval.
Configuration

You can customize memory monitoring thresholds and intervals in config.json:
```json
{
  "memory_threshold": 80,
  "check_interval": 5
}
```
memory_threshold: Percentage of memory usage to trigger alerts

check_interval: Seconds between memory usage checks when monitoring

Requirements

    Python 3.7+

    psutil

    rich

    Linux OS (requires /proc filesystem for some functions)

    notify-send command available for desktop notifications (usually via libnotify-bin package)
